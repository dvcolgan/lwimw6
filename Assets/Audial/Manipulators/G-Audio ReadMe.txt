We are proud to announce that Audial Manipulators now supports direct integration into your projects that use G-Audio. You can continue to use Audial Manipulators as components on your audio game objects, but each of the included effects can also be added directly into your G-Audio filter chain. Usage is incredibly simple: just unzip the "Assets/Audial/Manipulators/G-Audio compatible.zip" archive into your project folder and the filters will be accessible directly in the "Add Filter" dropdown menu in the G-Audio mixer panel.

We are still working on integrating all of the Audial Manipulator components, but the following components are ready for you to use:
Compressor
Crusher
Distortion
Foldback Distortion
Reverb*
Saturator
Simple Delay*

(* signifies that a component can not be used on the Master channel)
